			<h3>Undralu</h3>

			<p>Undrallu is a traditional South Indian dish made with rice flour. 
				It is a small, round, and white dumpling-like food that is commonly served as a snack or during festivals. 
				Undralu is a popular dish in many parts of India and is often prepared as a prasadam (offering) during Hindu festivals such as Ganesh Chaturthi, which is celebrated in honor of Lord Ganesha. 
				Undralu is believed to be one of Lord Ganesha's favorite foods, and it is commonly offered to him during puja (worship) rituals.
