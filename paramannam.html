			<h3>PARAMANNAM</h3>

			<p>Gulab jamun is a popular dessert in Indian cuisine, made by deep-frying small balls made of a dough of milk solids (khoya) and flour, which are then soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom, rose water, or saffron. 
				The name "gulab jamun" comes from two words: "gulab," which means rose water (used in the syrup), and "jamun," which refers to a small, dark fruit with a similar shape to the dessert.
				Gulab jamun is often served at festivals, weddings, and other special occasions, and is considered a traditional and classic dessert in many parts of India, as well as in neighboring countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh. 
				It can be served warm or at room temperature, and is often garnished with chopped nuts like almonds or pistachios.
