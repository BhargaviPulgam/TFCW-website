			<h3>Poornam</h3>

			<p>Poornam is a traditional South Indian sweet dish that is made during festivals and special occasions. 
				The word "poornam" means "fullness" in Sanskrit, which describes the rich and satisfying taste of this dessert.
				Poornam is not only delicious but also nutritious. Chana dal is a rich source of protein, fiber, and essential nutrients like iron and potassium. 
				Jaggery is a natural sweetener that is rich in minerals like iron and magnesium. Ghee, which is used liberally in the preparation of poornam, is a healthy fat that provides energy and aids digestion.

				<h1>PROCEDURE</h1>
				<h2>STEP 1:</h2>
				<p>Rinse and soak the chana dal in water for 2-3 hours.</p>

				<h2>STEP 2:</h2>
				<p>Drain the water and grind the dal to a coarse paste without adding any water.</p>

				<h2>STEP 3:</h2>
				<p>In a pan, heat 1 cup of water and jaggery, and stir until the jaggery dissolves completely.</p>

				<h2>STEP 4:</h2>
				<p>Add the ground chana dal paste to the pan and mix well. Cook on medium heat until the mixture thickens and forms a solid mass.</p>
					
				<h2>STEP 5:</h2>
				<p>Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool. Then, make small balls from the mixture and set aside.</p>

				<h2>STEP 6:</h2>
				<p>In a separate bowl, add the rice flour and mix with enough water to form a smooth dough.</p>

				<h2>STEP 7:</h2>
				<p>Take a small portion of the dough and flatten it into a small disc. Place a ball of the chana dal-jaggery mixture on top and cover the filling with the dough, shaping it into a ball.</p>

				<h2>STEP 8:</h2>
				<p>Repeat the process until all the dough and filling have been used up.</p>

				<h2>STEP 9:</h2>
				<p>Heat ghee in a deep frying pan on medium heat.</p>

				<h2>STEP 10:</h2>
