			<h3>Ugadhi Pacchadi</h3>

			<p>Ugadi Pachadi is a special dish made during the Ugadi festival, which is celebrated as the Telugu New Year in the southern states of India. 
				It is a unique and symbolic dish that represents the different flavors of life - sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and spicy.
				Ugadi Pachadi is made with six different ingredients, each representing a different taste and meaning. Jaggery is added for sweetness, tamarind for sourness, neem flowers for bitterness, salt for saltiness, green chili for spiciness, and raw mango for tanginess. 
				All the ingredients are mixed together in a bowl to create a delicious and complex flavor that represents the different experiences of life.                
				It is believed that eating Ugadi Pachadi on the day of Ugadi brings good luck, prosperity, and happiness in life. It also reminds people of the ups and downs of life, and to accept them with equanimity.
