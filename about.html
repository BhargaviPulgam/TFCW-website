								<h1>MY INSPIRATION</h1>
								<h3>The inspiration behind this website is deeply rooted in my family's heritage and my passion for cooking. 
									My great-grandmother, affectionately known as "avva," was a master in the kitchen and prepared a wide variety of traditional Telugu dishes whenever we visited her in our village of Alair. 
									Her knowledge of food and cooking techniques was vast and she instilled in me a deep appreciation for Telugu cuisine. 
									She encouraged me to learn and experiment with different dishes, and her inspiration led me to create this platform to share her recipes and bring the flavors of Telugu cooking to a wider audience.</h3>
