			<h3>GULAB JAMUN</h3>

			<p>Gulab jamun is a popular dessert in Indian cuisine, made by deep-frying small balls made of a dough of milk solids (khoya) and flour, which are then soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom, rose water, or saffron. 
				The name "gulab jamun" comes from two words: "gulab," which means rose water (used in the syrup), and "jamun," which refers to a small, dark fruit with a similar shape to the dessert.
				Gulab jamun is often served at festivals, weddings, and other special occasions, and is considered a traditional and classic dessert in many parts of India, as well as in neighboring countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh. 
				It can be served warm or at room temperature, and is often garnished with chopped nuts like almonds or pistachios.

				<h1>For one person the measurements and procedure for Telugu Chicken Biryani </h1>
				<p>1 cup milk powder</p>
				<p>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</p>
				<p>1/4 tsp baking powder</p>
				<p>1/8 tsp baking soda</p>
				<p>2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter, melted</p>
				<p>3-4 tbsp milk, or as needed to form dough</p>
				<p>Oil or ghee, for deep frying</p>
				<p>1 1/2 cups sugar</p>
				<p>1 1/2 cups water</p>
				<p>1/4 tsp ground cardamom</p>
				<p>1 tsp rose water (optional)</p>				
			</div>

			<div class="steps">
				<h1>PROCEDURE</h1>
				<h2>STEP 1:</h2>
				<p>In a mixing bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix well.</p>
				
				<h2>STEP 2:</h2>
				<p>Add the melted ghee or butter and mix it with the dry ingredients using your fingertips.</p>
				
				<h2>STEP 3:</h2>
				<p>Gradually add the milk, a tablespoon at a time, and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and soft. Cover the dough and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</p>
				
				<h2>STEP 4:</h2>
				<p>Meanwhile, in a saucepan, add the sugar, water, and cardamom powder. Mix well and bring it to a boil.</p>
					
				<h2>STEP 5:</h2>
				<p>Reduce the heat and let the syrup simmer for about 5-6 minutes, or until it becomes slightly thick. Turn off the heat and stir in the rose water (if using).</p>
				
				<h2>STEP 6:</h2>
				<p>Heat the oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</p>
				
				<h2>STEP 7:</h2>
				<p>Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth balls, without any cracks.</p>

                <h2>STEP 8:</h2>
				<p>Once the oil is hot, add the balls to the oil and fry them until they turn golden brown, stirring occasionally. Fry the balls in batches so that they don't stick together.</p>

                <h2>STEP 9:</h2>
				<p>Using a slotted spoon, remove the fried balls and transfer them to the syrup. Let the balls soak in the syrup for at least 30 minutes before serving.</p>

                <h2>STEP 10:</h2>
				<p>Serve the Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts if desired.</p>
