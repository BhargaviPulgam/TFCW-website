# WEBSITE - **TELUGU FAMILY COOKING WONDERS**

**Telugu Family's Cooking Wonders** is a platform dedicated to providing authentic Telugu recipes for everyone who loves to cook, regardless of skill level. The website has a strong emphasis on offering simple instructions and in-depth knowledge of the ingredients and preparation techniques used in Telugu cuisine. The website serves a wide range of customers, from those interested in learning more about Telugu cuisine to foodies looking for fresh, interesting dishes. For visitors to provide feedback and recommendations, the website also includes a variety of tools such a suggestion box, contact form, and social network links.


The four HTML pages on Telugu Family's Cooking Wonders are "index.html," "about.html," "recipecollection.html," and "contact.html." These pages organise the site's material. There are connections on the "recipecollection.html" page to other HTML pages with individual recipe information and also there are two css pages called "styles.css" and "recipestyles.css" to style "index.html," "about.html," "recipecollection.html," and "contact.html." HTML pages and other linked HTML pages respectively. The website's design makes it simple for users to navigate and find the information they're looking for. Additionally, the website's pages have been organised methodically with a logical hierarchy of information to make it easy for users to access the information they need. Telugu Family's Cooking Wonders has integrated media queries with various screen dimensions to accommodate various screen sizes and provide the best possible user experience.

I recognize that the index.html and about.html pages are similar, the other html pages such "chickenbiryani.html" can be considered as the 2nd main HTML page other than the "about.html". To gather and store user input, Telugu Family's Cooking Wonders' contact page includes a suggestion box. It is now failing to function, though, and instead of storing user feedback, it displays the result on the console rather than doing so. In order for the suggestion box to work correctly, user input must be saved in a different file or database to make it easier to examine and use in the future. I acknowledge the advantages of JavaScript and JSON in recipe development for the website "Telugu Family's Cooking Wonders". However, due to time restraints, a lack of knowledge, I was unable to integrate these tools. 

Telugu Family's Cooking Wonders recipecolleciotn.html page was inspired to create its website by Indian Healthy Recipes, with slight change which can be found at [Indian Healthy recipes](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/recipes/andhra-veg/). Furthermore, styling was added to the website using the Swiper.js library, which is available at [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/demos#pagination).
